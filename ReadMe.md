## About Me💡
I'm a software developer. I like thinking of very niche, useful software apps and creating them. I enjoy working across the full stack and mixing technologies you wouldn't normally think to use together.

Open to full-time opportunities and project collaboration.

### What I've Been Working on Lately:

- 🔭 Currently working on a [platform](https://gitreps.com) to help connect developers to open-source work and showcase contributions.
- 🌱 Developing some exciting, useful Discord bots!!
